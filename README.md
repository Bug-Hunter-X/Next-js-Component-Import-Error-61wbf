# Next.js Component Import Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with Next.js: importing and rendering components from different directories. The issue occurs when a component is correctly defined but fails to render in the main application, resulting in an empty or broken page. This issue is often accompanied by unclear error messages.

## Bug Description

The bug stems from an incorrect approach to importing and rendering the component. The primary cause is often a missing or incorrect import path or a failure to export the component correctly.
